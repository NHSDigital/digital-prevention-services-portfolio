## Replacing NBSS (the National Breast Screening Service)

The processes involved in breast screening include identifying participants, arranging appointments, taking mammograms, reading images, and recording results.

The systems currently used by breast screening offices (BSOs) to manage these tasks are no longer fit for purpose. By 2028 we aim to replace them with modern, digital services.

### Designed for the NHS, by the NHS

We’re designing bespoke services for the NHS, and we’re doing it in house. Some key advantages of this are: 

* integration with the NHS App and NHS Notify
* improved accessibility
* greater information for participants about appointments and results
* improved data quality and sharing across systems 
* single sign on (no need to remember multiple usernames and passwords)
* reduced paper
* reduced costs
