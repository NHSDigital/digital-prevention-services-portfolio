<p>Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) is part of <a href="">NHS England</a>. We’re here to <strong>help build the NHS that keeps you well, before you need the NHS that makes you better</strong>. </p>

<p>We play a central part in the government’s high-level strategy for the NHS: </p>

<p>analogue → digital<br /> 
sickness → prevention<br /> 
hospital → community </p>

<p>We build digital services, platforms and components to support NHS screenings, vaccinations, and personal prevention.</p>

<p>Our 10-year goal is radical reimagination of preventative healthcare.</p>
