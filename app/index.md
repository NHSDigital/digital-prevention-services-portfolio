intro: |
  Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) is part of [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk). We play a central part in the government's high-level strategy to [build an NHS that's fit for the future](https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-term-plan/):

  analogue → digital
  sickness → prevention
  hospital → community

  **We build and maintain the essential digital infrastructure for NHS preventative healthcare**. We build practical digital tools for patients and NHS staff; and provide specialist expertise in user research, service design, content, technology, and more.
