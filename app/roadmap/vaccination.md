The Vaccination Digital Services (VDS) team is here to protect the NHS and public, particularly those facing vaccine inequalities, by ensuring more people get vaccinated, more easily.

### Recently completed

- GP surgeries and community pharmacies have access to digital services to help them accurately record the vaccinations they administer, including a way to sign-up directly via the new [Record a vaccination service](https://www.ravs.england.nhs.uk/login) (RAVS) website
- community pharmacy vaccination providers in London have a quicker, more accurate way to record flu, MMR and pneumococcal vaccinations using [RAVS](https://www.ravs.england.nhs.uk/login)
- vaccination providers now have access to a service ([Manage Your Appointment](https://www.nhs.uk/manage-your-appointments/login)) that helps them manage millions of vaccination appointment slots across thousands of locations, as part of the [Vaccinations National Booking Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/vaccinations-national-booking-service)
- digital support in place for early-adopter pharmacies across parts of England, which means people can get RSV and pertussis vaccinations, and for the first time, infant-flu vaccinations for 2-3 year-olds
- three additional school-aged vaccination providers in the Midlands, Hertfordshire, and East of England are using digital services for planning and recording HPV and MenACWY, TD/IPV and flu vaccinations in schools ([Manage Vaccinations in Schools](https://digital.nhs.uk/blog/transformation-blog/2025/an-easier-way-to-manage-vaccinations-in-schools))
- helping clinicians and commissioners make more informed decisions by enabling vaccination data to flow more easily between GP and other clinical systems
