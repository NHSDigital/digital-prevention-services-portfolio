The Digital Screening team works on providing provide safe, efficient, high quality and nationally consistent screening services for adult participants. We’re driving a shift to home testing, and transforming clinic-based screening.

### Recently completed

- rollout of a new service to help NHS staff manage cervical screening ([Cervical Screening Management System](https://www.service-catalogue.nhs.uk/services/cervical-screening-management-system))
- now sending millions of digital communications for bowel cancer and cervical screening
- a new service to improve the quality of data used to invite people for breast cancer screening ([Cohort manager](https://www.service-catalogue.nhs.uk/services/create-screening-cohorts))

### Up next

- adding self-testing as a new mode for cervical screening participants who have previously not attended clinic-based screening
- expanding the use of digital communications to participants in breast cancer screening
- piloting a new service for staff working in breast screening, giving them a quicker, easier way to manage the screening process, and freeing them up to spend more time with participants
