Our job is to scale up home tests across a wide range of biomarkers. HomeTest will provide commercial, clinical, and digital capabilities, providing easier access to essential tests – enabling faster diagnosis, improved condition management and bringing care closer to home.

### Recently completed

- setting up HomeTest team, securing and allocating funding
- HIV test ordering via national channels agreed as initial area of focus (eg, NHS App)

### Up next

- design and ratification of our end-to-end service offering, including how citizens order tests and onward pathway integration
- strategic commercial model design and approval aimed at streamlining contracting and assurance for commissioners
- care integration pattern design, providing a blueprint for plugging in the HomeTest service into existing care pathways
- initial alpha build across NHS App and other national services enabling low-friction at-home test ordering and results
- identification and prioritisation of long-term at-home tests across an array of conditions to help support locally delivered healthcare
